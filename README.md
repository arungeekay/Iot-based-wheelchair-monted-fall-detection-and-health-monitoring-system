# Iot-based-wheelchair-mounted-fall-detection-and-health-monitoring-system

Around the world we see many people who are physically challenged. One among them are those
who use wheel chairs. In present situation a person on a wheel should have a care taker who always
looks after the person on the wheel chair. It is really difficult for the caretaker to keep an eye on the
patient all the time. If in case when the patient is resting and there is no one with him/her, suddenly
an incident happens it will lead to risk of life of patient. This is major drawback of the wheel chairs
that are in use currently.
In order to overcome this problem, we have brought in a new concept and developed a smart wheel
chair which monitors patient’s bloop pressure and fall detection. This will drastically help the
caretaker to have a regular check of patient’s health. We also use cloud services to send the
information about the patient to the caretaker.
Smart Wheelchair is known as a Power Wheelchair that is integrated into multiple sensors, assistive
technology, and computers that give the user with a disability such as impairment, handicaps, and
permanent injury, the required mobility to move freely and safely. These types of wheelchairs are
gradually replacing the traditional wheelchairs; however, their expensive costs are preventing a large
size of disabled people from having one. According to the organization of World Health (WHO),
only 5 to 15% out of 70 million disabled people have access to wheelchairs. Therefore, we need to
offer a cost-effective Smart that not only minimized the cost but also provides plenty of features that
use the latest components and technologies. In the last years, there have been many pleasant efforts
that serve this purpose. They have adopted various technologies such as artificial intelligence, where
they have designed an autonomous wheelchair that used machine learning concepts to navigate, and
some also used Internet of Thing technology to control the wheelchair-using voice recognition
system. This report will present a cost-effective Smart Wheelchair-based Arduino Nano
microcontroller and IoT technology that have several features to gain disabled people, especially
poor people who cannot afford expensive Smart Wheelchair, the required help to finish daily life
tasks without external help. To conclude this project will make the Smart Wheelchair affordable to
a wide range of disabled people and will be based on Arduino Nano, ESP-12e module to give Wi-Fi
access, MPU6050 to detect fall with Voice message notification using ThinkSpeak platform.
